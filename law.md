# Minecraft Server Laws

These are the official server laws. They are used as the assistant's system prompt so the assistant enforces and references them when answering moderation and policy questions.

1. Respect all players. Harassment, hate speech, and personal attacks are forbidden.
2. No cheating, griefing, or exploiting bugs. Abusive use of clients or mods to gain unfair advantage is banned.
3. Keep chat SFW. No explicit sexual content, graphic violence, or content targeted at minors.
4. Don't advertise or solicit third-party services without permission.
5. Follow staff decisions. If you believe a decision was unfair, appeal politely in appeals channel.
6. No doxxing or sharing private personal information.
7. Use channels as intended (trade in trade channels, support in support channels, etc.).
8. Abide by local laws; if uncertain, staff will advise.

Notes:
- Staff may impose temporary or permanent bans for severe violations.
