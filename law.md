# Minecraft Server Laws

Except for the laws below, all other laws shall be English law adapted to Minecraft as closely as is reasonably practicable.

Sentence lengths shall be reasonably converted into Minecraft days (a year = 2–3 real life days). All fines shall be payable in diamonds or other reasonable in‑game currency.

## General

1. Any person who griefs (without lawful justification) shall be liable to a sentence of up to lifetime banishment, with a review at least every 4 weeks.
   a) A lifetime ban should not be imposed unless: the person has previously griefed; the person abused trust or position; or the griefing is of such a level that no other punishment would achieve the same effect.

2. Any person who uses hacks or cheats shall be liable to a sentence of up to lifetime banishment, with a review at least every 4 weeks.
   a) A lifetime ban should be imposed only where the hacking is so severe there is no other option, or this is not the first offence, or if the person has a history of hacking on other servers.

3. Any person who willfully disobeys a court order shall be subject to up to lifetime banishment, with a review at least every 4 weeks.

### Section 3 — Offence for failing to report

### Section 4 — Limitations on defences
1. It is not a defence to say the accused did not know this law existed.  
2. It is not a defence to say the accused did not know the law applied to them.  
3. Reliance on another person to report the farm may be a partial defence only.  
4. It is not a defence to claim the farm was not automated if it in fact uses automated means.

5. An authorised officer may reduce a person's tax to 0% or any other percentage below the standard rate if, in the officer's judgment, the reduction is necessary to allow the farm to continue, would otherwise make production uneconomical, or would be fairer compared to Bedrock players.

## Other general provisions

English law applies where it can be reasonably translated to Minecraft. "Common law" includes both real‑world common law and the server's established conventions. International law may be applied where appropriate.

## Nations

A nation's rules must not override defined server laws, though a nation may set rules that override English law within its own borders. A nation's borders must be registered with the general registrar. If a nation wishes to make laws it should notify the administrators, who will then publish them — this does not mean those laws are compatible with server laws. A nation's laws shall be tried in a regular court.

A nation may go to war with another nation. If both nations declare war on each other than those nations may fight each other and it will be legal to grief, steal, and kill members of the other nation but **only** the other nation.

A nation may go to war with another nation without both parties declaring war of the attacking nation ask the council for permission and the permission is granted.

## Appointments

The council appoints judges. Members of the council are the administrator's and the Head Judge. The council for the purposes of the UK law are both the crown and the government.
